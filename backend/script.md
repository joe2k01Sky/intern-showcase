# Intro
So before starting I'd like to shoutout all the people in my team both on the business and delivery side.
So our stakeholders, develoers, scrum master and product owner. I'd like to thank them for allowing me to seamlessy drop into the team and have a wonderful internship experience.

# Projects
My team works on two internal sky websites, the shadowing app and the agile university which I'm sure some of you will have heard of. Within these two projects I worked on various areas. Both backend and frontend within the shadowing app project and some DevOps and DocOps on the agile university as well. So I've had the opportunity to have kind of a full stack development experience here at sky which is something I really enjoyed.

# Internship in numbers
Throughout these 8 weeks I...
Obviously I can't show all of that so I'm just going to show a couple of highlights.

# Tabs
I'm now going to show you two of the components I worked on in the agile university frontend, the first one being this reusable tabs component. You know it's a pretty common web component that we weren't using within the agile university. It lets developers conditionally render views, you can see a dummy example here. It's fully customisable, so it should fit any situation where this behaviour is needed.

# Search bar
The second component I'm going to show is this searchbar which performs autocompletion against a backend server rather than on the client side to improve performance. In this demo it returns dog breeds but you'll see in a moment how it's being used in the agile university. Whenever the user selects an option the searchbar return a json object with the information about said object that the developers can then use to do whatever they need to do.

# Implementation
This short video is a recording of a page I designed and implemented in the au website which lets admins extrapolate data for analytics purposes.
